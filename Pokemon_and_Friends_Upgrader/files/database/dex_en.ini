746="When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather."
747="Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie of the Galar region have not yet figured out that the branches of Corsola are delicious."
748="Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect."

811="When it’s drumming out rapid beats in battle, it gets so caught up in the rhythm that it won’t even notice that it’s already knocked out its opponent."
812="The one with the best drumming techniques becomes the boss of the troop. It has a gentle disposition and values harmony among its group."
813="It has special pads on the backs of its feet, and one on its nose. Once it’s raring to fight, these pads radiate tremendous heat."
814="It kicks berries right off the branches of trees and then juggles them with its feet, practicing its footwork."

839="While it’s engaged in battle, its mountain of coal will burn bright red, sending off sparks that scorch the surrounding area."
